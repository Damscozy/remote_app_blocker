# # The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
# flutter:

#   # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
#   # assets:
#   #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
#   #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
#   #
#   # For details regarding assets in packages, see
#   # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package
#   #
#   # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
#   # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

#   # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
#   # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
#   # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
#   # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
#   # example:
#   # fonts:
#   #   - family: Schyler
#   #     fonts:
#   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
#   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
#   #         style: italic
#   #   - family: Trajan Pro
#   #     fonts:
#   #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
#   #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
#   #         weight: 700
